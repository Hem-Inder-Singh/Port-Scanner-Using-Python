# Port-Scanner-Using-Python
Port scanning is a fundamental technique used in cybersecurity to detect open ports and running services on a networked system. This project implements a multi threaded port scanner that
scans a specified range of ports on a target IP, identifies open ports, and attempts to retrieve
service banners. The scanner provides insights into potential security vulnerabilities by revealing
exposed services.
# How The Project Works:
1. **Target Input**:The user enters the target IP address and the range of ports to scan.
2. **Socket Connection:** The script attempts to establish a connection to each port.
3. **Service Identification:** If a port is open, the scanner tries to identify the running service.
4. **Banner Grabbing:** The scanner retrieves any available banner information from the open
port.
5. **Multithreading for Speed**: The scanning process is optimized using Pythonâ€™s
ThreadPoolExecutor, allowing concurrent scanning of multiple ports for faster results.
6. **Formatted Output:** The results are displayed in a structured table, highlighting open
ports, detected services, and banners.
# Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Import the required modules (socket, concurrent.futures, sys).
2. Define a function to scan a given port using a socket connection.
3. Implement a get_banner() function to retrieve the banner from open ports.
4. Use ThreadPoolExecutor to scan multiple ports concurrently.
5. Capture and store results, including open ports, services, and banners.
6. Format and display the results in a structured manner.
7. Provide user input prompts for specifying the target IP and port range.
8. Handle errors and exceptions for robust execution.
